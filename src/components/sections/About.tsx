          I work at the intersection of design and development — Design & Code — with a growing focus on AI-augmented workflows. I care about clarity, craft, and systems that scale.

          Based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, I lead as Creative Director at SlabPixel and work across visual branding, UI/UX, motion, and web development. I believe design is how it works — not just how it looks — and I focus on solutions that meet real goals. I’ve helped shape brands and products for clients like Visuel Colonie, Sibambo Studio, ID.VC, and Nada Payments, and I co-founded Upshift.Supply for design inspiration and learning. I never stop learning and always see room to improve; that mindset drives everything I do.
